Careful : the directories names are designed to pass the grademe's exam simulator.
In the real exam, there is one more underscore :
here : cpp_module00
during the real exam : cpp_module_00

The main.cpp fileS are copied from the subjects.
The last one (ex02) is completed by one specific line, which the grademe's simulator does not test, whereas the real exam does. Check the launchSpell with NULL, and an unknown spell.

During the exam, be careful about your .cpp files name !

At Nice's campus, VSCode is available.

bash -c "$(curl https://grademe.fr)"
